        <h1>Grocery Stores</h1><hr>
        <p>Grocery stores in Bangladesh range from small neighborhood shops to large modern supermarkets. Local grocery stores, known as kirana dokan, are common in both urban and rural areas and typically offer daily necessities like rice, lentils, oil, salt, and soap. Traditional wet markets are also popular, especially for buying fresh vegetables, fruits, fish, and meat, where bargaining is common. In urban areas, modern supermarkets like Shwapno, Meena Bazar, Agora, and Unimart provide a more organized shopping experience with a wide variety of local and imported products. In recent years, online grocery platforms such as Chaldal.com and Khaas Food have gained popularity, offering home delivery services and digital payment options. The grocery retail scene in Bangladesh is evolving rapidly, blending traditional shopping habits with modern convenience.</p><br>
